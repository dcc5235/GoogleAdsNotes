# Google Ads Certificate Notes

<details><summary>Why Google Ads?</summary>
  
Google Ads provides access to a broad range of advertising products designed to help you reach customers. To help you grow your business, Google Ads is built around three principles: relevance, control, and results.
  
  - Relevance: Google Ads helps you connect with the right people, at the right time, with the right message. Your ads can appear on Google Search, YouTube, and more, just when someone is looking for products or services like yours. You can also customize options, such as keywords and location, to get in front of the most relevant customers.
  - Control: Google Ads gives you complete control over your budget. You choose how much to spend per month, per day, and per ad. Based on your settings, Google Ads uses a lightning-fast auction to determine which ad to show. If you want to change your strategy, you can easily adjust your ad, modify your budget, or pause and restart a campaign.
  - Results: Pay only for results, like clicks to your website or calls to your business. Our measurement tools make it easy to see how your site, apps, and ads are performing. Plus, smart technology lets you create, manage, and optimize your campaigns so you can get the most out of your investment.
  
#### Advance your business goals
Your advertising campaigns should center around the objectives you have for your business. 
  - Drive sales: Grow online, in-app, in-person, and over-the-phone sales.
  - Get leads: Boost conversions by encouraging people to take action.
  - Increase website visits: Get the right people to visit your website.
  - Influence consideration: Encourage people to explore your products and services.
  - Build awareness: Reach a broad audience and maximize exposure.
  - Promote your app: Increase installs and interactions with your app.

<details><summary>Google Ads campaign types</summary>
Advertising with Google Ads starts with creating a campaign based on your business objectives. Each campaign type determines where your ads appear and the format in which those ads are displayed. 
  
#### Search
Search ads appear next to Google search results and on other Google partner sites, like YouTube, when people look for businesses like yours. With a Search campaign, you can make sure potential customers notice your brand, consider your products, and take action.
  
#### Display
Google Display ads can appear across a network of more than two million sites and apps, reaching 90% of people on the internet. Your ads get matched to content related to your business or to your customers' interests. Use a Display campaign to increase exposure and reach audiences with specific interests across the web.
  
#### Video
With Video ads, you can reach the right audience at scale and capture their attention. Show your ads on their own or within other streaming video content on YouTube and across Google’s network of websites and apps. Only pay when people choose to watch your ad. Video campaigns help you bring your business’s story to life. They engage customers in different ways, like showing ads before their favorite music video or while they're researching an upcoming purchase.
  
#### Shopping
Shopping ads appear on Google Shopping next to search results and near text and responsive ads. Shopping ads promote your products by giving consumers detailed information about what you're selling before they even select your ad. Use a Shopping campaign to advertise your online and local inventory, boost traffic to your website or local store, and find better-qualified leads.
  
#### App
After a simple setup process, App campaigns run ads across Google’s largest properties, including Search, Play, and YouTube, as well as thousands of mobile sites and apps. Your ads and bids are automatically adjusted to get the most downloads. Just add a few lines of text, a bid, and some assets, and the rest is optimized to help customers find you. With an App campaign, you can increase engagement, app installs, and even in-app actions, like signing up for a newsletter or ordering a product.

#### Specialized campaign types
Google Ads can help you meet those goals through specialized campaign types.
  - Local campaigns help you drive important offline metrics — like store visits or in-store sales — by advertising on multiple platforms. It can optimize how your ads appear on Search, Maps, Display, and YouTube to maximize your offline performance.
  - Hotel campaigns
  - With Discovery campaigns, you can easily engage customers across Google’s most popular properties with a variety of rich, unique ad formats. Reach your users across the YouTube Home Feed, Gmail, and Google’s Discover Feed — all with one campaign.
  
#### Optimize your campaign
While the campaign type you choose determines where users see your ads, you can customize plenty of features to make sure you engage the most meaningful audiences, wherever they are.
  - Device targeting: Reach your customers on any device, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
  - Locations and language targeting: Your campaign’s ads are eligible to show to customers in particular locations, or to customers who've chosen your selected language as their browser’s language setting.
  - Bidding and budget settings: Your bid strategy controls how you pay for users to interact with your ads. Your bid limit is the most that you’ll pay per click for ads in an ad group, and your budget is the average amount that you’re comfortable spending each day on your campaign. The budget that you choose is entirely up to you, and you can adjust it at any time. 
  - Ad extensions: Include even more information with your ads, such as location details, links to pages on your website, and your phone number.

#### Display campaign types
There are two campaign types for you to choose from — Smart and Standard.

  - Smart Display campaigns are a campaign type that uses full automation. It bundles together all the pillars of successful Display campaigns and accesses the best of Google’s machine learning capabilities to optimize and automate nearly all aspects of your Display campaigns. You provide a few inputs: what your ads will say, images you want to use, daily budget, and cost-per-acquisition (CPA) performance targets. Google will mix and match your ads at scale. 
    - To be eligible to set up a Smart Display campaign, you need to have gotten at least 50 conversions on Display — or at least 100 conversions on Search — in the last 30 days.
    - Create your campaign in minutes by providing just three inputs: budget, bid, and creative assets. Then, rely on multiple Google machine learning technologies to provide ongoing optimization and find you as many customers as possible.
    - You receive all standard Google Ads reporting and then also get new, supplemental reports based on insights that allow broad, strategic management instead of daily micromanagement.
    - Smart Display campaigns run across the three million websites and apps available on Google Display ads, including AdMob and Google owned and operated properties such as YouTube.
    - There are three core automation models that drive Smart Display campaigns: automated bidding, automated targeting, and automated creatives.
      - Automated bidding: Instead of bidding manually, you specify a Target CPA or Target ROAS you’d like to achieve and Google will manage the CPC bids on a per-auction basis, based on the likelihood that the auction will generate a conversion.
      - Automated targeting: Targeting optimizes where the campaign runs, which means ads increasingly show where they’ll get you the most business. Smart Display campaigns drive remarketing and prospecting alike.
      - Automated creatives: Ads are automatically generated from the building blocks you provide, like headlines, descriptions, logos, and images. They responsively fit into almost all ad slots across Google Display ads. Smart Display campaigns can also use your data feed to render dynamic ads based on the items in your feed.
  - Smart Display campaigns rely on the existing CPA model to set the bids at the right time. They also use a new auto-targeting infrastructure to deliver the best of Display targeting across the entire mid- and lower-funnel, and leverage a new auto-optimized creative technology to combine raw creative assets (logos and images), and build custom ads for each auction.
  - You should use Smart Display ads if you are new to display advertising and want a fast and highly performing campaign, have limited display advertising to remarketing but now want to reach people earlier in the buying process, and want to attract additional customers beyond your manually targeted campaigns or simplify your existing campaign structure.

#### What's a Standard Display campaign?
If you’re looking for full control over all aspects of your Display campaign, then a Standard Display campaign is right for you. You can manually select your targeting, bidding, and ad formats.

  - Targeting: When building your first Display campaign, there are three marketing objectives you'll be able to choose from:
    - Build awareness: Increase how well people know your brand.
    - Influence consideration: Encourage people to explore your products or services.
    - Drive action: Get sales or leads by motivating people to take action.
  
  - Bidding: It’s important to choose a bid strategy that reflects your marketing objectives. 
    - Enhanced CPC: Automatically adjusts your manual bid up or down based on each click’s likelihood to result in a conversion
    - Maximize Conversions: Drive as much conversion volume as possible within your budget
    - Target CPA: Automatically sets bids to help you increase conversions while reaching your average cost-per-acquisition goal
    - Target ROAS: Automatically sets bids to help get as much conversion value as possible at the target return on ad spend you set
  
  - Ad Formats: There are two main types of ad formats you can leverage for your Display campaign.
    - Responsive Display ads: Greater efficiency and scale

<details><summary>Reach Users on Google Display Ads</summary>
  
#### Display targeting
You can use targeting to direct your campaign’s ads to the people you want to reach most. Simply choose the targeting option that aligns to your campaign goal and Google Display ads will work to get your ad in front of the right people, in the right place, at the right time.

Note: If you choose to use the marketing objectives option on a Display campaign, Google Display ads will guide you to the targeting options designed to work best with your goal.
  
#### Build awareness
When you want to reach a broad audience and maximize your brand exposure, we recommend selecting build awareness as your Display campaign marketing objective. 
  
  - Demographic targeting enables you to show ads to users based on a combination of declared and inferred data. You can target based on age, gender, and parental status. 
  - With Affinity audiences, you can reach TV-like audiences based on a holistic picture of their lifestyles, interests, and passions. Choose from over 100 segments based on online behavior. Google’s best-in-class algorithm distinguishes these users that are truly passionate about a topic rather than those that are merely interested.
  - If one of the 100+ off-the-shelf Affinity audiences doesn’t meet your needs, create your own with Custom Affinity audiences. This feature allows you to define and target custom-made audiences, giving you substantive reach against niche groups of users.
  
#### Influence consideration
When you want to engage with users that are actively researching products or services, we recommend selecting influence consideration as your Display campaign marketing objective.

  - In-Market audiences: Reach potential customers while they're actively browsing, researching, or comparing the types of products you sell and are close to a conversion. Connect with those most interested in what you have to offer, using precise segments that classify users based on their demonstrated in-market behavior and purchase intent.
  - Custom Intent audiences: If you want to create a tailored audience that isn't covered in one of our In-Market audience segments, Custom Intent is for you! Define and reach people that have the intent to purchase, updated in real-time. Simply enter keywords or URLs that best represent your audience or choose from one of our auto-created audiences.
  - Similar Audiences: Similar Audiences finds users that are similar to an original remarketing list or other uploaded compatible list. It finds users that are similar in profile based on their recent browsing and interests around different topics.

#### Drive action
When you want to re-engage with users that have already shown interest in your brand, we recommend selecting drive action as your Display campaign marketing objective.
  
  - Remarketing: Remarketing lets you show ads to the people who demonstrated their interest in what you offer with their visit to your website or app. It’s how you reconnect with great prospects as they browse the millions of websites and apps available on the network.
  - Standard remarketing: Show ads to your past visitors as they browse network websites and use network apps. Communicate with people who've previously visited key pages on your website across screens, giving you a powerful new way to match the right user with the right message.
  - Dynamic remarketing: Work to boost your results with dynamic remarketing, which takes remarketing to the next level with ads that include products or services that people viewed on your website. Create dynamically generated display ads with product data pulled from a pre-uploaded feed. You can achieve great performance showing to users products they have seen on your website, with low effort in campaign, ads, and remarketing lists creation.

<details><summary>Increase Efficiency with Automated Bidding</summary>
  
#### What's automated bidding?
Bidding is a key success factor for online marketing, and the bid strategy you choose directly influences how your campaigns perform and how visible your ads are in the unique moments that are important to your business. Google Ads offers several bid strategies that are tailored to your marketing goals and different types of campaigns. 
  
  - Factors to automatic bidding: performance (Bids influence how visible your ads are and the amount of interaction you get in each unique moment. If you don't bid efficiently, you could miss valuable conversions), auctions (Given the dynamic nature of our auctions, the appropriate bid can often be a moving target that's challenging to reach at scale when using manual bidding), and user complexities (Many signals influence user behavior. Their intent and likelihood to complete valuable actions for your business vary based on location, time, device, and so on. Taking all these signals into account for every auction and bidding can be done through automation).
  - Benefits of Google Ads automated bidding: The goal of any marketing campaign is to reach the right user with the right message at the right time. As consumers span across multiple devices, the customer journey has become more complex and so has setting bids based on each user's context.
    - Machine learning: Automated bidding uses machine learning to algorithmically help you set the appropriate bid for each and every auction. This takes much of the heavy lifting and guesswork out of setting bids, so you can meet your performance goals more efficiently and accurately.
    - Time saved: Cross-referencing audience data with context to establish intent and set the appropriate bid is a complex and time-consuming task. Automation offers a way to alleviate this strain on marketing resources.
    - Auction-time bidding: Our bidding algorithms tailor bids to each user’s unique context, using relevant signals present at auction time. This is a unique capability in the market, as it allows for bid differentiation, with a high degree of precision based on the conversion opportunity of each auction.
    - Depth of signal used and cross analaysis: Our algorithms integrate a large variety of signals and consider new ones to evaluate user intent. They also go a step beyond traditional signal analysis by recognizing and adjusting for meaningful interactions between combinations of signals while constantly considering new ones.

  #### Choose the right bidding strategy
It’s important to choose a bidding strategy that reflects your marketing goals. Google Ads offers several bid strategies to choose from. Which strategy you choose depends on which networks your campaign is targeting and whether you want to focus on improving clicks, visibility, conversion, and so on.

  - Awareness-based bidding strategies: You should choose this bid strategy if you want to make sure that your ad is visible for certain queries and even at certain locations on the page.
    - Target impression share: This helps make sure your ads are meeting a specific impression share threshold for a specific location on the search results page: anywhere, top of page, or absolute top of page.
    - This is for raising awareness of your brand and campaigns that include brand terms.
  - Consideration-focused bidding strategies: You should choose this bid strategy if you want to drive as many clicks as possible within a set level of spend.
    - Maximize clicks: Set bids to try to get you as many clicks as possible within a target spend amount that you choose.
    - Budget-constrained campaigns focused on driving clicks per volume. Upper funnel keywords that have high assist value in conversion
  - Conversion-focused bidding strategies: Choose one of these bid strategies if you're tracking actions post-click, valuing conversions equally, and looking to maximize the number of conversions. 
    - Maximize Conversions: Drive as much conversion volume as possible within your budget. You don't need to provide a specific cost per click (CPC), cost per acquisition (CPA), or return on ad spend (ROAS) target. Target cost-per-acquisition (tCPA): This strategy automatically sets bids to help you increase conversions while reaching your average cost-per-acquisition goal. Enhanced cost-per-click (eCPC): This strategy automatically adjusts your manual bid up or down based on each click’s likelihood to result in a conversion.
    - Maximize Conversions: Advertisers that want to spend a fixed budget and don’t have an explicit CPA/ROAS goal
    - Target cost-per-acquisition (tCPA): Maximize amount of conversions, without considering order value — such as lead generation and eCommerce businesses. 
    - Enhanced cost-per-click (eCPC): For Search, this is for advertisers who want to set the core bid manually or through third-party bidding tools, with an added layer of real-time optimization. 
  - Revenue-focused bidding strategies: Choose this bid strategy if you’re tracking the revenue or value associated with your conversions and want to maximize it at a specific return on ad spend target. They’re a good fit if you’re tracking conversion value and have campaigns that have at least 50 conversions in the past 30 days for Search and at least 15 conversions in the past 30 days for Display.
    - Target return on ad spend (Target ROAS): Automatically sets bids to help get as much conversion value as possible at the target return on ad spend (ROAS) you set
    - If you want to automatically optimize bids to maximize revenue within your target ROAS

<details><summary>Deliver the Right Message on Google Display Ads</summary>
  
#### Display ad formats
Creatives are the face of your brand through advertising, so you want to make sure they represent you well. Ad formats let you choose how to communicate your business to your audience. 
  
  - Why Display ad formats? 
    - Display ads can help you promote your business when people are browsing online, watching YouTube videos, checking Gmail, or using mobile devices and apps.
    - With Google Display ads, you can take an approach that enables greater efficiency or greater creative control. 

#### Responsive Display Ads
  - Responsive Display Ads are Google’s marquee Display ad format and are the default ad type when creating a Display campaign. They represent the future of asset-based digital advertising.
    - Responsive Display Ads give you the ability to upload your own assets and create ads that serve in all ad slot sizes, into both native and non-native inventory. Simply upload your assets (images, videos, headlines, logos, and descriptions), and Google will automatically create ads. They're built for performance, reach, and scale.
    - Not only do Responsive Display Ads look great, they perform. On average, we tend to see 50% more conversions at a similar cost-per-acquisition (CPA) when advertisers add Responsive Display Ads to their image ad campaigns.
    - Automation: When you create a Responsive Display Ad by uploading different assets into Google Ads, Google uses a machine learning model to determine the optimal combination of assets for each ad slot based on predictions built from your performance history.
    - Reach: Multiple assets can be uploaded per asset type, such as headlines, logos, images, and videos. The ads that Google assembles automatically adjust their size, appearance, and format to fit just about any native or non-native ad slot. 
    - Simplicity: By using Responsive Display Ads, you can reduce your overhead for managing ad portfolios within ad groups and campaigns and dedicate more time to performance improvement.
  - Creative testing: Google does billions of creative A/B tests for your business. Google also leverages multiple machine learning modules (asset selection, color extraction, auto-fitting, and more) to create the right message to the right user across desktop, mobile, and apps.
  
#### Uploaded ads 
Uploaded ads offer greater control over the way your ads look and feel. You build your own ads outside of Google Ads and simply upload them to your Display campaign.
  - What are image ads? Created outside of Google Ads (in Google Web Designer, for example), image ads are uploadable as a .zip file into Google Ads. Image ads only run in banner-eligible slots, which has limited scale relative to Responsive Display Ads.
    - Note: In order to qualify for as many auctions as possible, it’s recommended to have both Responsive Display Ads and image ads in your Display campaign.
    - Complete creative control: You can develop these ads yourself using templates to decide how best to combine your different images, text, and logos.

  - What are AMPHTML ads?
    - AMPHTML ads enable marketers, publishers, and technology providers to deliver faster, and more secure ad experiences across all platforms by applying the principles of AMP to building and serving ads. 
    - Faster ads drive better performance: AMPHTML ads are 6x faster than regular ads on AMP pages, making them more viewable, more effective, and more likely to perform well.
    - Lighter ads can lead to better ad experiences: AMPHTML ads are 3x lighter in load and rendering than regular ads which may result in users having a more positive experience with your brand. 
    - Safer ads build trust in your brand: AMPHTML ads need validation before they’re served, reducing the risk of malware and building trust in the brands users are engaging with.

<details><summary>Increase Conversions with Performance Planner</summary>
  
#### Why you should plan for performance with Performance Planner
Planning is the crucial first step to achieving success with Google Ads. By planning your Google Ads budgets on a monthly basis in advance, you can help ensure that when people need products or information, your ads can meet them at the right time to help maximize conversions and achieve your key performance indicators (KPIs).

By planning your Google Ads budgets in advance, you can:
  1. Understand the future spend potential of current Google Ads campaigns to help drive budget decisions
  2. Take advantage of seasonality to capture incremental opportunities 
  3. Set optimal bids and budgets across your campaigns to help ensure that ROI performance is maximized
  4. Find new opportunities to grow your sales volumes with Google Ads
  
  - What's the Google Ads Performance Planner?
    - Performance Planner is a new forecasting tool that uses machine learning to reveal the possibilities for your Google Ads campaigns. With this tool, you can explore forecasts for your upcoming monthly, quarterly, and annual budgets for current campaigns, while also helping to improve your return on investment.
    - Performance Planner determines the optimal bids and average daily budget allocations across all of your campaigns to help increase the number of conversions you can achieve for any future spend scenario. 
    - Using Google’s seasonality data and insights, Performance Planner will predict the results if you use optimal bids and average daily budgets across your campaigns to maximize the number of conversions for any future spend scenario.
    - When you choose a spend point on the blue line, Performance Planner will improve your ROI by reallocating spend between campaigns through adjusting bids and average daily budgets.
  
  - Forecasting
    - Google Search ad auctions — made up of billions of searches per week — powers our forecast engine.
    - Our forecast engine simulates relevant ad auctions with query level variables, including seasonality, clickthrough rate, competitors, landing page, and time of day.
    - We use machine learning to fine tune forecasts and achieve a higher level of accuracy.
    - We perform forward and backward measurements of accuracy for thousands of campaign samples — across one, seven, 30, and 90 day periods — to ensure we’re making valid recommendations.
  
#### How to use Performance Planner

1. Learn: Create a new budget plan to learn the best bids and budgets for your campaigns to drive incremental conversions.
2. Explore: Explore further optimizations and forecast how you can grow your business with Google Ads.
3. Do: Review and implement changes prescribed by your Performance Planner plan.
4. Repeat: Ensure you react to external factors and optimize to the target metrics set. Use Performance Planner on a monthly basis for best results.
  
  - Optimal budgets and bids are crucial to getting the most of your marketing budget
    1. The additional conversions you can generate at the same spend using Performance Planner.
    2. The incremental number of conversions you can achieve and maximum amount you can spend without diminishing returns (maintain your current CPA)
    3. The incremental number of conversions you can achieve and maximum amount you can spend at your desired target CPA goal (in order to remain profitable)
    4. Additional spend and resulting conversion scenarios at higher target CPA goals (reduce profitability to increase total conversion volume) 
  
  - Why should I use Performance Planner every month?
    - Seasonality, fluctuating auctions, and competitors mean that Google Ads campaigns should be planned and optimized on at least a monthly basis. Using Performance Planner every month lets you optimize your budgets and bids so you can drive more conversions for the same investment.
    - Don't add all brand and generic campaigns into the same plan. That's because different campaigns often have different marketing objectives. Incremental conversions are achieved by creating separate plans for each marketing objective.
    - Forecasts improve when plans are generated closer to the actual run date. Make sure to regularly check back on your plan before implementing it.
  
#### Take action with Performance Planner
Once you use Performance Planner to create a plan with the target date, campaigns, budget, target conversion volume, and target cost-per-acquisition (CPA) for upcoming periods, the tool will provide one of the recommendations below. These recommendations are campaign settings forecasted to help drive maximum conversions and the most efficient return on your investment for your targeted budget.

  - Search Manual cost-per-click (CPC) or Enhanced CPC campaigns: Recommended average daily budget and campaign bid scaling (1.5 scaling means + 50% bid scaling)
  - Search Maximize Clicks or Maximize Conversions campaigns: Recommended average daily budget
  - Search Target CPA or Target return on ad spend (ROAS) campaigns: Recommended average daily budget, Campaign-level Target CPA, or Campaign-level Target ROAS
  - Performance Planner provides a CSV download with the recommended bid scaling, Target CPA, Target ROAS, and average daily budget amounts. You can manually apply these suggestions through the Google Ads campaign management interface, or you can download a Google Ads Editor file and upload to Google Ads Editor to see and action the recommended changes.
