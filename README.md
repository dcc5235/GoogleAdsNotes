The ad auction is Google’s way of deciding which ads will show and how they’re positioned.

#### How the Google Ads auction works
Google Ads uses an auction system to rank the ads that appear on the search results page, and to determine the cost for each ad click. The order in which ads appear on the page is based on a calculation called Ad Rank. 

Google users want ads they see to be relevant, and advertisers want to show relevant ads so that users will actually click on them.

Google uses a special version of a second-price auction that takes into account more than just bids. In a standard second-price auction based only on bids, the advertiser doesn’t have to pay their full bid. They only have to pay $0.01 more than the amount of the next highest bidder.

Say we have four advertisers competing for space on the search results page, and they’re willing to pay $4, $3, $2, and $1, respectively, for a user to click on their ad and visit their website. The first advertiser was bidding $4, but they'd only have to pay $3.01—which is $0.01 above the bid of the second highest advertiser. 
  
#### How Ad Rank determines your ad position
Google Ads calculates Ad Rank for every ad in the auction. Ad Rank determines your ad position and whether your ads are eligible to show at all. Generally speaking, the ad with the highest Ad Rank gets to show in the top position, and the ad with the second highest Ad Rank gets to show in the second position (assuming the ads clear the relevant thresholds), and so on.

1. Bid: When you set your bid, you're telling Google Ads the maximum amount you're willing to pay for a click on your ad. You often actually end up paying less, and you can change your bid at any time.
2. Ad rank threshold: To help ensure high-quality ads, we set minimum quality thresholds that an ad must achieve to show in a particular ad position.
3. Context of query: Context matters - looks at search terms the person has entered, the person’s location at the time of the search, the type of device they’re using (e.g., mobile or desktop), the time of the search, the nature of the search terms, other ads and search results that show on the page, and other user signals and attributes.
4. Ad extensions impact: When you create your ad, you have the option to add extra information to your ad, such as a phone number, or more links to specific pages on your site. Google Ads estimates how extensions and other ad formats you use will impact your ad's performance.
5. Auction-time ad quality: Google Ads also looks at how relevant and useful your ad and the website it links to are to the person who'll see it. Quality Score is an aggregated estimate of our assessment of the quality of your ad.
