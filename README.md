# Google Ads Certificate Notes

<details><summary>Why Google Ads?</summary>
  
Google Ads provides access to a broad range of advertising products designed to help you reach customers. To help you grow your business, Google Ads is built around three principles: relevance, control, and results.
  
  - Relevance: Google Ads helps you connect with the right people, at the right time, with the right message. Your ads can appear on Google Search, YouTube, and more, just when someone is looking for products or services like yours. You can also customize options, such as keywords and location, to get in front of the most relevant customers.
  - Control: Google Ads gives you complete control over your budget. You choose how much to spend per month, per day, and per ad. Based on your settings, Google Ads uses a lightning-fast auction to determine which ad to show. If you want to change your strategy, you can easily adjust your ad, modify your budget, or pause and restart a campaign.
  - Results: Pay only for results, like clicks to your website or calls to your business. Our measurement tools make it easy to see how your site, apps, and ads are performing. Plus, smart technology lets you create, manage, and optimize your campaigns so you can get the most out of your investment.
  
#### Advance your business goals
Your advertising campaigns should center around the objectives you have for your business. 
  - Drive sales: Grow online, in-app, in-person, and over-the-phone sales.
  - Get leads: Boost conversions by encouraging people to take action.
  - Increase website visits: Get the right people to visit your website.
  - Influence consideration: Encourage people to explore your products and services.
  - Build awareness: Reach a broad audience and maximize exposure.
  - Promote your app: Increase installs and interactions with your app.

<details><summary>Google Ads campaign types</summary>
Advertising with Google Ads starts with creating a campaign based on your business objectives. Each campaign type determines where your ads appear and the format in which those ads are displayed. 
  
####Search
Search ads appear next to Google search results and on other Google partner sites, like YouTube, when people look for businesses like yours. With a Search campaign, you can make sure potential customers notice your brand, consider your products, and take action.
  
####Display
Google Display ads can appear across a network of more than two million sites and apps, reaching 90% of people on the internet. Your ads get matched to content related to your business or to your customers' interests. Use a Display campaign to increase exposure and reach audiences with specific interests across the web.
  
####Video
With Video ads, you can reach the right audience at scale and capture their attention. Show your ads on their own or within other streaming video content on YouTube and across Google’s network of websites and apps. Only pay when people choose to watch your ad. Video campaigns help you bring your business’s story to life. They engage customers in different ways, like showing ads before their favorite music video or while they're researching an upcoming purchase.
  
####Shopping
Shopping ads appear on Google Shopping next to search results and near text and responsive ads. Shopping ads promote your products by giving consumers detailed information about what you're selling before they even select your ad. Use a Shopping campaign to advertise your online and local inventory, boost traffic to your website or local store, and find better-qualified leads.
  
####App
After a simple setup process, App campaigns run ads across Google’s largest properties, including Search, Play, and YouTube, as well as thousands of mobile sites and apps. Your ads and bids are automatically adjusted to get the most downloads. Just add a few lines of text, a bid, and some assets, and the rest is optimized to help customers find you. With an App campaign, you can increase engagement, app installs, and even in-app actions, like signing up for a newsletter or ordering a product.

####Specialized campaign types
Google Ads can help you meet those goals through specialized campaign types.
  - Local campaigns help you drive important offline metrics — like store visits or in-store sales — by advertising on multiple platforms. It can optimize how your ads appear on Search, Maps, Display, and YouTube to maximize your offline performance.
  - Hotel campaigns
  - With Discovery campaigns, you can easily engage customers across Google’s most popular properties with a variety of rich, unique ad formats. Reach your users across the YouTube Home Feed, Gmail, and Google’s Discover Feed — all with one campaign.
  
####Optimize your campaign
While the campaign type you choose determines where users see your ads, you can customize plenty of features to make sure you engage the most meaningful audiences, wherever they are.
  - Device targeting: Reach your customers on any device, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
  - Locations and language targeting: Your campaign’s ads are eligible to show to customers in particular locations, or to customers who've chosen your selected language as their browser’s language setting.
  - Bidding and budget settings: Your bid strategy controls how you pay for users to interact with your ads. Your bid limit is the most that you’ll pay per click for ads in an ad group, and your budget is the average amount that you’re comfortable spending each day on your campaign. The budget that you choose is entirely up to you, and you can adjust it at any time. 
  - Ad extensions: Include even more information with your ads, such as location details, links to pages on your website, and your phone number.
